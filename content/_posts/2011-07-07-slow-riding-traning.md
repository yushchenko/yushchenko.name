# {{ page.title }}

Preparing to my pre-provisional test I started to train in slow riding.
The exercises are quite simple such as cone wave, U-turn etc.
Speed is around 8-12 km/h, clutch riding on the first gear.

The first session on the parking lot was frankly terrible.
U-turns in a meter outside of the marked box,
two or three cones are dropped down in cone wave and so on. 
Humiliating feeling of own clumsiness.

The next couple of sessions were spent just to find out how to control the motorcycle
on such low speed. 
The progress was quite fast, I started to notice the changes. 
Now it's much easier to keep the bike during quite sharp turns, 
still not perfect, but at least U-turn is not an issue any more.

Somewhere at this stage I perceived a quite unexpected thing. 
During my regular street and freeway riding sensation of motorcycle has changed. 
Better control, more precise cornering, sometimes it feels like 
the bike is just an extension of your body.

There is also a downside, my street riding has become a bit more aggressive and risky. 
Looks like, if you can ride fast, you will ride fast. Just automatically. 
So the next task is find out how to control yourself and keep risk on moderate level 
using the acquired skills.
