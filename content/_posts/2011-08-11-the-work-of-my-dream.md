Several thoughts about work, a bit of random and barely sorted.

Prefer dynamic languages and Unix environment.
JavaScript, Node.js, Python, Ruby (probably), Emacs, Git, Github etc.
Used to program for .Net but now it seems clumsy and overcomplicated for me.
Like and know SQL but don't think that RDBMS is the right storage option in all situations.

Like play with UX. Typically use 95/5% approach.
95% - well known patterns, controls etc plus 5% - innovations, inventions, extensions and so on.
Enjoy 'webish' looking interfaces such as Github, Twitter, Gmail and Google Reader.
An Outlook style app in browser makes me sick.

Love simple (not primitive) solutions.
If it's possible to store data in text file, I am not using a DB, even object oriented one.
When write JavaScript (Python), the text file is going to be rather in JSON (YAML) than XML.
The ideal solution - no code at all. No code - no bugs - no support etc.
In reality I try to minimise own codebase as much as possible
using an appropriate development process, language(s), tools and libs.

It's lovely to play with algorithms, data structures and performance optimisation.
An example, http://jsperf.com/fibonacii-numbers-for-digital5-test (sorry for mistype in the URL), 
the task was to calculate Fibs without recursion in C# and explain why recursion is a bad idea here.
As you can see, it's quite easy to overcome recursion's drawback (fibMemoization case)
using an approach quite typical for a dynamic language like JavaScript but rather unusual for C#.

Unfortunately, I don't have systematic knowledge in Mathematics or Computer Science.
Would be glad to study Math, algorithms, academic programming languages like Haskel, Scheme etc.
Looking for an appropriate project for that. Will be happy to invest spare time.
When worked at Frayman Group, a couple of my colleagues were dealing with full text search
and knowledge extraction (if using the right term), I envied them.

Believe, knowledge of the project's domain area is crucial, expect an advice of several good books.
Interested in building systems where software is only a part, of course, an important one.

Working hard to improve my writing skills.
Use variety of tools from Twitter to project's wikis.
Still far from perfect, the same as all spell checkers that I ever saw, so sorry for mistakes.

Looking for a way to build a personal knowledge base.
In my mind it's currently wiki + source control + Emacs mode + scripts + web services and browser plugins.
Using a simple version of this approach for my current project at CaseWork.

Like to experiment, sometimes do weird things.
Can install motorcycle's mirrors on top of my monitors
or bring to the office a fitness ball to sit on.

Weekly it's 128h of life vs 40h of work,
so I use 'life-work balance' phrase instead of its 'work-life' equivalent.
40h per week is enough to get work done.
The rest is better to spend for studying than sitting out colleagues at the office.
I respect other people's time and expect the same in return.

It's pretty much all for the current moment.
My understanding of life is evolving over the time,
so I will upgrade this list or may be even rewrite it from scratch in the future.
