Twitter can be used to develop awareness.

When you read your stream you are here and now, the past doesn't matter,
no point to dig into last year's posts.
When you follow others you build you feature, pave you way ahead,
developing understanding what is important and what is not.
When you are posting, you are trying to pick up subtle,
very subtle details of the present and drop them into the future.

The idea is achieve a compound effect of many micro changes,
like a big picture is drown by many minor touches.
Of course, Twitter is only one tool in huge range of many other.
It seems good for small, probably, additional shifts
but at the same time it's really cheap in usage and mistakes, definitively, worth trying.
