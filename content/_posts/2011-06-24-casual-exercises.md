# {{ page.title }}

When you are cooking, making tea or doing other everyday tasks,
there are always tiny pauses.
Waiting for one, two, three minutes.
Too small to switch to something else.

The idea is pretty simple.
Fill these pauses with easy to do, 'casual' exercises.
Something like bends, squats, head rotation and so on.
They should be fairly simple but, at the same time,
be on one small step out of your 'comfort zone'.

The benefits are not dramatic but quit noticeable.
Better blood circulation during the day leads to reduce in fatigue.
Improvements in flexibility and coordination make your movements smoother and more natural.
Obviously, the routine tasks are felt not so annoying.
A little habit that improves quality of life without spending any extra time.

It's quite interesting to observe these slow improvements.
I remember the time a couple of years ago when a low bend made me to feel sick.
Now I can read a book laying on the floor for a quite long time.
It's comfortable and fun. Why not?
